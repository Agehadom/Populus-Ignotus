<h2><strong>Summary</strong></h2>

<p>Populus Ignotus is a game made in Javascript built with Web 3.0 tech in mind. Populus Ignotus is inspired by games like Journey and Sky with emphasis on the connection between active users in an online environment. 

I want it to play like a 2D platformer where the only real goal is to interact with each other as they wish, exploring the world and finding items. It's not so much a game but more like a sandbox. With Web 3.0, I plan to integrate blockchain technology to allow any of the possessions that a user may have to have value within the world and out.

With a modern, artistic direction, I desire Populus Ignotus to be a resting place.</p>

    <strong>
        Front-End
    </strong>
</h2>

<ul>
  <li>Javascript</li>
  <li>NextJS</li>
  <li>Chakra UI</li>
  <li>ThreeJS</li>
</ul>

<p>Good old Javascript with a React based framework with ThreeJS working as my game engine to render 3D meshes and elements within the game throughout the page. Chakra UI is something that I like to work with for making clean pages.</p>

<h2><strong>Back-End</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li>NextJS</li>
  <li>Django?</li>
</ul> 

<p>NextJS should be useful here, storing private, game relevant information since as loot tables or game logic that I wouldn't want to store near users. Django is my theoretical solution for storing things like userdata that Truffle won't necessarily handle with a simple connection to a ETH wallet. This is only an idea and there is probably a much better solution that I'll deal with familiar down the line.</p>

<h2><strong>Web 3.0</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Truffle</li>
</ul> 

<p>My Web 3.0 ETH tech of choice to begin the learning process. It was a hard choice between Hardhat and Truffle as Hardhat is open source and Truffle is more established. For the sake of learning, I believe that it is a better idea to work with Truffle.</p>

<h2><strong>Networking</strong></h2>

<ul>
  <li>Websockets</li>
</ul> 

<p>Websockets allows for remote clients connect to our backend. Websockets does things like sync positions, worlds, locations; whatever may be relevant in the game world between the users and server.</p>
